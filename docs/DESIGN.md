# DecDRM — design

DecDRM is a Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM30) receiver **and** transmitter written in Rust.
This document records the decisions from the kickoff Q&A (2026-09-29), the architecture,
and the milestone plan. Keep the milestone checklist current.

## Decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Standard scope | DRM30 robustness modes **A, B, C, D**; all spectrum occupancies (0–5, 4.5–20 kHz); 4/16/64-QAM; SM, HMsym, HMmix; short & long interleaving; all protection levels. No DRM+ (mode E), no analog AM/SSB/FM, no AMSS. |
| Purpose | Personal / hobby. |
| Relationship to Dream | Spec-first idiomatic Rust, freely translating Dream's proven algorithms (sync, Wiener channel estimation, MLC decoding). Licence therefore **GPL-2.0-or-later**. Reference: Dream `branches/dream-mjf` r1548. |
| Receiver performance | Match or beat Dream on weak/fading signals (Wiener channel estimation, soft-decision Viterbi, iterative MLC, sample-rate-offset tracking). |
| Audio decoding | Behind a Rust codec interface. AAC / HE-AAC v1/v2 and **xHE-AAC** via **FDK-AAC** (vendored, built from source, statically linked). **Opus** (Dream's extension) via libopus. CELP/HVXC: detected and reported as unsupported. |
| Data services | Text messages, Journaline, MOT Slideshow, EPG, Broadcast Website, TPEG/unknown (raw data saved). Broadcast clock and alternative-frequency (AFS) info from the SDC. |
| Inputs | Recorded files (WAV/FLAC; real IF or I/Q; any sample rate) and live sound card (including a virtual audio cable fed by web SDRs such as KiwiSDR). No direct SDR drivers, no network clients. |
| Outputs | Live audio (with clock-drift compensation) and logs/metrics (CSV/JSON). |
| Transmitter | Full transmitter: AAC/HE-AAC (FDK encoder), xHE-AAC (libxaac encoder), Opus, plus **EnCodec** (Meta's neural codec, via candle) as an experimental DecDRM-only extension. Carries every data service the receiver decodes. Output to WAV/FLAC file and sound card. Includes a channel simulator (spec channel models) for loopback testing. |
| UI | Library crates + CLI + desktop GUI (**egui**). The GUI has RX/TX modes like Dream; the transmitter is also scriptable from the CLI with a TOML config. |
| Platforms | Windows x86_64 (primary), Linux x86_64. |
| Workflow | Max autonomy; commit per milestone; local git + private GitHub repo `CasualArclamp/DecDRM`. |
| First milestone | Audio from a real recording, end to end, via the CLI. |

```

* **decdrm-core** (pure Rust, no I/O, no C): mode/occupancy tables, OFDM cell map and
  pilots, receiver chain (input conditioning → frequency acquisition → time sync → OFDM
  demodulation → pilot-based sync → channel estimation → cell demapping → FAC/SDC/MSC
  decoding), FEC (energy dispersal, convolutional code, puncturing, soft Viterbi, bit and
  cell interleaving, MLC), FAC/SDC parsing, MSC demultiplexing, audio super-frame parsing,
  text messages, and the transmitter chain (the exact inverse) plus the channel simulator.
  DSP runs in `f64` (`Complex<f64>`); PCM audio is `f32`.
* **decdrm-codecs**: safe wrappers over FDK-AAC (DRM transport `TT_DRM`, configured with
  the raw SDC type-9 bytes, as Dream does) and libopus.
* **decdrm-data**: packet-mode reassembly, MSC data groups, MOT (slideshow, broadcast
  website, EPG objects), Journaline, EPG binary→XML, TPEG/raw capture — decode and encode.
* **decdrm-io**: WAV/FLAC reading and writing, resampling to the 48 kHz working rate,
  sound-card input/output via cpal.
* **decdrm-engine**: glues the above together on threads (input → receiver → audio out),
  owns the codec/data registries, publishes status snapshots for the UIs, writes logs.

### Receiver data flow

The receiver is push-driven and single-threaded internally: `Receiver::push(&[samples])`
runs every stage for which enough input is buffered and emits `ReceiverEvent`s (status,
FAC/SDC updates, audio super-frames, data-stream frames, text messages). Stages keep their
own buffers; timing/frequency corrections flow backwards through explicit feedback fields
rather than shared global state (Dream's `CParameter` is split into typed per-stage state).

Working sample rate is **48 kHz** (Dream's `SOUNDCRD_SAMPLE_RATE`), at which the useful
symbol lengths are 1152/1024/704/448 samples for modes A/B/C/D.

## Milestones

- [ ] **M0 Setup** — workspace, references, design doc, git + private GitHub.

      AAC audio (FDK) → WAV + playback, via CLI, on the mode A/B 10 kHz samples.

      interleaving, flipped spectrum, I/Q inputs, offsets; Wiener channel estimation,
      iterative MLC, SRO tracking; minimal modulator + channel simulator for modes/SOs we
      have no recordings of (mode D, 4.5/5/18 kHz).

## Conventions

* Cite the spec in doc comments: `ES 201 980 §7.3.2`. When an algorithm is borrowed from
  Dream, name the Dream file/class it came from.
* No `unsafe` outside the `*-sys` crates and the thin FFI wrappers in `decdrm-codecs`.
* Tests: unit tests per module; integration tests decode files from `samples/` and are
  skipped (not failed) when the samples are absent; loopback tests use our transmitter.
* `samples/` (user-provided recordings) and `reference/` (Dream source, specs) are not
  committed.
